Rules And Commitments To This Project
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
By engaging with this repository and thus the content stored within it, you agree to be a committed team member and then follow the following policies to the best of your abilities:

-  Keep clear communication with team members on your own work or lack thereof.
-  Abide by deadlines and work to complete work by them. Any problems here should be clearly communicated so that other members can pick up Slack.
-  Ultimately, we are a team; this means pointing fingers or placing blame is irrelevant, and instead, the focus should be on cooperation.
-  Try to find dedicated time to work on a weekly basis so that the workflow is steady.
-  Meetings will likely take place once or twice a week. Attendance is highly recommended, though again, clearly communicate if there are absentees.
-  If questions cannot be answered alone, seek out the help of other team members or the supervisor.
-  Prioritise your own work and jobs first; however, helping each other is massively encouraged so long as it does not impede your own work.
-  Be ready to adapt to a changing climate and or new responsibilities.
  
-   In the end, just try and be a good teammate, please, and thank you!
